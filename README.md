# Laptop Price Prediction:
We made an Machine Learning model to predict the Laptop price based on the 
company name,type of laptop,weight,inches,screen resolution,ram,operating system
,cpu brand,Gpu brand,HDD,SSD and finally shows the overview of the selected values in the 
above features,along with predicted price.

I tried many machine learning algorithms and i got Adaboost algorithm 
perform very well in predicting the laptop price,Adaboost algorithm got
82% during training time and 81% during testing time.

Then I take test samples from amazon website to test my final model,result i got is 
almost similar to the price which in the amazon website.
